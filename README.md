# Bingify Web Extension
**"Makes Google look a little bit like Bing."**

## Summary
Google's homepage by default looks a little bit boring with its plain white background. Bing, on the other hand, is quite cool with its daily changing wallpapers (and sometimes videos), but when it comes to search, it doesn't give you the best results.

Now Bingify gives you the best of both worlds: Google's homepage and high-class search engine combined with Bing's picture of the day.

## Target
This web extension targets the Firefox desktop browser (version 45+). Other platforms and WebExtensions-compatible browsers have not been tested and are therefore not currently supported.

## Prerequisites
In order to build and run the web extension from this repository, the following software components are required:
- Visual Studio Code (1.31+)
- Node.js LTS (10.15+)
- web-ext command line tool

## Build and Run
This repository comes with a `tasks.json` file that lets you build and run the extension using *web-ext* from within Visual Studio Code easily. Just execute the "Build" or "Run" task, and all the magic happens.

## Copying
See [LICENSE.md](/LICENSE.md) for details.
